# front-end-projects
A collection of my frontend development projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository showcases my learning journey, hands-on experiments, UI components, mini-projects, and full-page designs. Each project is organized in its own folder with clean code, reusable structures, and responsive layouts.
